Lovers' names
Carved in walls
Overlap
Start to merge
Some of them
Underneath
Maybe they appear
In graveyards
Maybe they fade away
Weathered and
Overgrown
Time has told
Meaningful
Hidden words
Suddenly appear
From the murk
Maybe they're telling us
That the end
Never was
Never will
Words have gone
Meaning will
Never disappear
From the wall
