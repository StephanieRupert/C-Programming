Lovers names
Carved in walls
Overlap,
Start to merge
Some of them underneath
Maybe they appear
In graveyards
Maybe they fade away
Weathered and overgrown
Time has told
Meaningful hidden words
Suddenly appear
From the murk
Maybe theyre telling us
That the end
Never was
Never will
The words have gone
But the meaning will never disappear
From the wall
