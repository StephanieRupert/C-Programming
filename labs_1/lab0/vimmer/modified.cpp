For nature crescent does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk; but  as this temple waxes, 
The inward service of the mind and soul 
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister, 
Grows wide     withal. Perhaps he loves you now, 
The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own; 
For he himself is subject to his birth. 
He may not, as unvalued persons do, 
Carve for himself,  for on his choice depends 
The safety and health of this whole state,
And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd 
Unto the voice and yielding of that body and 
Whereof   he is the head. Then if he says he loves you, 
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it 
As he in his particular act and place
deed; which is no further 
Than the main voice  of Denmark goes withal. 
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain 
If with too credent ear you list his songs, 
Or lose   your heart, or your chaste treasure open
To his unmast'red importunity. 
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister, 
And keep you in the rear of your affection, 
Out of the shot and danger of desire. 
The chariest maid is prodigal enough
If she unmask her beauty     to the moon. 
Virtue  itself scopes not calumnious strokes. 
The canker galls the infants of the spring 
Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd, 
And in the morn and  liquid dew of youth
Contagious blastments are most imminent. 
Be wary then;  best safety lies in fear. 
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
